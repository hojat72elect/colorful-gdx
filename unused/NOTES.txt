In release 0.6.1, the oklabSaturation() method is just wrong. But, so are chromaLimit() and maybe chroma(). I really
have no idea what's happening, but the saturation is exceeding 1.0 by a significant factor, and mostly for blue or
nearby colors. I noticed this while in the middle of a change to how lightness is handled, but the issue predates that
(back to 0.6.1 at least). There's another issue where 0.6.1 only produces colors with a lower chroma than they should
have, and working around that isn't too hard (it involves removing some `* 0.5` and changing `0x1p-18` to `0x1p-16`).
I think the way the gamut is generated probably has some bug in it. For example, pure blue (0x0000FFFF) claims a
chroma of 0.31835338, and a chroma limit of 0.22460938 (or 0.16016015 in a case with different lightness). The chroma
seems accurate for the reported A and B channels, so the limit is much too small.
