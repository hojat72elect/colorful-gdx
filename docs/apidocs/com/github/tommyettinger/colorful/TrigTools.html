<div class="block">Some alternative approximations to sin(), cos(), asin(), acos(), and atan2(), including the option to measure
 most values in turns instead of radians (where 1 turn equals 2pi radians). The convention here is to have methods
 that take input in turns or produce output in turns use a <code>_</code> suffix, like <a href="../../../../com/github/tommyettinger/colorful/TrigTools.html#sin_-double-"><code>sin_(double)</code></a>, for turns to
 never be returned as a negative value but for negative turn inputs to be accepted, and for the output type to match
 the input type (float input gives float output, double input gives double output).

 is closely related to a cubic sway, but the shape of the output when graphed is almost identical to
 sin(). The difference between the result of this method and <code>Math.sin(double)</code> should be under 0.0011 at

 floats you should usually use methods that take floats (or return floats, if assigning the result to a float),

 performance regression, but not likely that the JDK's Math.acos() will speed up by 30x (Math.cos() has sped up,
