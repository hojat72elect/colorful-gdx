<h1>Whoops, this page moved.</h1>
<h3>
<a href="ColorTableValueSimpleOklab.html">You probably want the moved page here.</a>
</h3>
<p>
This page was called ColorTableSimpleValueOklab.html, but due to clean-up it is now called ColorTableValueSimpleOklab.html .
Sorry, but I don't know how to do an automatic redirect on GitHub Pages.</p>
